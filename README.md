# rock-paper-scissors

I created this project to test my JavaScript knowledge. It's a simple rock, paper, scissors game where
the user plays against a program that randomly picks between the three choices. Additionally I decided
to add a glorified design to this project to further enhance my HTML and CSS skills.
